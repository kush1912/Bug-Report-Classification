# **Bug Report Classification -Lucene-Java**
This repository consists of the Major Project I am doing in 7 semester. Project aims at classifying the Bug reports related to Lucene Java into 7 categories. Our future scope is to built a model which can automatically classify the bug reports, and send it to the respectibe debugger. The dataset for this has been created from JIRA which is a proprietary issue tracking product developed by Atlassian that allows bug tracking and agile project management.    

As students we didn't had access to Jira software and, one of the major challenges was to create the dataset cause it allows you to download 1000 Bugs in one go. So, in order to over come this issue use [this](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/export-more-than-1000-issues-to-excel-from-issue-navigator-in-jira-cloud-779160811.html?_ga=2.146190068.1166170942.1569584815-930848358.1569584815) link and code in the browser to get the dataset. &tempMax=1000&pager/start=1000
