# **Bug Report Classification -Lucene-Java**
This repository consists of the Major Project I am doing in 7 semester. Project aims at classifying the Bug reports related to Lucene Java into 7 categories. Our future scope is to built a model which can automatically classify the bug reports, and send it to the respectibe debugger. The dataset for this has been created from JIRA which is a proprietary issue tracking product developed by Atlassian that allows bug tracking and agile project management.    

The project is incomplete, stay tuned.
